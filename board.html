    <h2 class="major">Network Security</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">A network security specialist is a professional who focuses on ensuring information confidentiality, integrity and availability.
        Network security utilizes proactive techniques, including defense-in-depth and layered security, to mitigate or eliminate
        vulnerabilities in information systems and to protect against potential exploitation. This may include network and application
        penetration testing, software and hardware reverse engineering as well as developing exploits for identified vulnerabilities.
        Security professionals possess intimate knowledge of critical business components. The Network Security degree reflects the
        application of theory and is aligned with industry standards and guidelines. It provides students with the opportunity to
        synthesize and apply the vital skills and knowledge necessary to succeed in the cyber security workforce.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
    <h2 class="major">Network Security Degree Objectices</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">1. Create a network infrastructure design communications document that includes identified hardware components,
        connections to outside world, identified physical layer connectivity (media) and addressing, including operational and
        security components in the design.<br>
        2. Install, configure and test security hardware and software tools with supporting documentation such as port scanners,
        vulnerability detection systems, intrusion detection systems, firewalls, system hardening, anti-virus tools, patch
        management, auditing and assessment.<br>
        3. Construct, implement and document a script or a program to automate a security-related process or other tasks such as
        installation, administration, management, mapping resources, logon scripts, patch management, updates, auditing,
        analysis and assessment.<br>
        4. Create a policy or procedure that addresses events such as: a disaster recovery plan, a business continuity plan, an
        incident response policy, an acceptable usage document, an information security policy, a physical security policy,
        assessments or troubleshooting procedures.<br>
        5. Develop a research report or implementation plan concerning legal and ethical best practices and mandated requirements
        that pertain to information security.<br>
        6. Research, document, test and evaluate several current industry information security based threats, risks, malicious
        activities, covert methodology, encryption technologies, mitigation techniques or unconventional tactics to prevent loss of
        sensitive information and data confidentiality, integrity and availability.</p>

    <h2 class="major">Artificial Intelligence</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">Artificial Intelligence (AI) explores the theory and development of tools that simulate thinking, patterning and advanced
        decision behaviors by software running on computing devices. AI applications are able to solve and navigate complex
        scenarios that require drawing inferences appropriate to situations, performing decision-making using complex and changing
        data, discovering meaning, generalizing conclusions based upon learned events and from experience. AI approaches within
        software form the underpinnings of autonomous devices, such as self-driving vehicles and drones. Technologies such as big
        data analysis, voice recognition, simulation agents and IoT devices all require AI algorithms. UAT studies in AI cover
        fundamentals of general and applied artificial intelligence including core programming languages and platforms used in
        computer science. Advanced coursework encompasses applying principles of natural language processing, machine learning,
        behavior simulation and deep learning based upon big data sets. Students prepare for future-oriented AI uses by applying
        computer science approaches and AI concepts as they develop solutions to real-world projects within production studio
        settings</p>
        <br>
        <br>
    <h2 class="major">Artificial Intelligence Degree Objectices</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">1. Develop, analyze and integrate artificial intelligence application and IoT systems.<br>
        2. Demonstrate skills to design and create natural language processing systems.<br>
        3. Demonstrate designing and creating machine learning systems using best practices and patterns.<br>
        4. Demonstrate new and original data in deep learning by consuming big data with original algorithms.<br>
        5. Demonstrate software development skills using more than one programming language, development environment,
        platform, and source control system.<br>
        6. Describe, develop, analyze, integrate data structures, databases, and database management systems.</p>
