Since you have to wait 5 seconds between each iteration, the countdown will wait for a multiple of 5 seconds for each iteration. For example, for the 40 second mark, which is 8*5, the function will wait for 5000 ms(5 seconds)*(-8) + 10. 5 seconds times 2 equals 10 seconds, and 50-40=10. I'm really bad at explaining this stuff. If you read this far, sorry for your brain.
